# Yneko-Reimu Optimization Progress

## 2026-05-30

- Started implementation from approved plan.
- Confirmed clean git worktree before edits.
- Added task tracking files for the optimization implementation.
- Added Vite, Composer/PHPCS scaffolding, and changed build/package scripts to build before packaging.
- Moved the upstream Reimu source mirror out of the installable theme tree into `vendor-src/reimu-upstream`.
- Updated README build-script notes for Vite and PHPCS.
- Generated WebP derivatives for banner, search background, and screenshot using ImageMagick.
- Updated image helpers to prefer WebP banner/search assets and responsive banner sources.
- Added lightweight JSON-LD schema output with `yneko_reimu_schema_enabled` and `yneko_reimu_schema_graph` filters.
- Promoted main content wrappers to `<main>` and changed listing cards to semantic `<article>` elements.
- Added block pattern registration and extended `theme.json` spacing/typography settings for a stronger block-editor baseline.
- Added pattern styling and reduced-motion CSS support.
- Updated release workflow to run Vite build and PHPCS/WPCS before packaging.
- Adjusted loader CSS build so cursor PNGs remain external cacheable files instead of Vite-inlined base64.
- `composer install` could not run locally because Composer is not installed in this Windows environment.
- Added docs for development, hooks, release packaging, and Theme Check expectations.
- Updated packaging so repository docs referenced by README are included in the release ZIP.
- Updated README release checks and directory tree for the new toolchain layout.
- Synced the English README development section with the new Vite/PHPCS workflow.
- Replaced theme screenshot with the user-provided compressed PNG from `C:\Users\86135\Downloads\screenshot.png`.
- Fixed the release workflow after the first v0.1.2 tag run failed because CI had not installed npm dependencies before running Vite.
